# OPENRNDR Android template

## Develop

1. Clone the OPENRNDR repository from https://github.com/ArthurVimond/openrndr and check out the `feature-android-support` branch.
2. Build a local snapshot version by running the command: `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal snapshot`
3. Gradle sync and run the app

NB: This is still a work-in-progress to make OPENRNDR programs running on Android.
